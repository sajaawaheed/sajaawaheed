### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**sajaawaheed/sajaawaheed** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I am a recent M.S. Bioinformatics graduate with a with experience analyzing data in Python and R. I am searching for a professional Bioinformatics Analyst role and would like to use Github to showcase my experience with self driven projects where I reanalyze/recreate data and figures from published papers. I have special interest in diseases of the brain and spinal cord I would love to further my experience with projects that will lead me into the subfield of neuroinformatics.
